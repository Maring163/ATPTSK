# ATPTSK
This code is a Python implementation of the paper "An Adaptive Three-Parameter softmin Based Takagi-Sugeno-Kang Fuzzy System for High-Dimensional Data"

The paper proposes an adaptive three-parameter softmin for approximating the minimum T-norm, based on which a novel Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy model is derived, i.e., ATPTSK. Then, two techniques are designed to mitigate the overfitting of ATPTSK and enhance its performance, respectively.
